# De_Castlejau_Algorithm_Bieser_Curve
OpenGL implementation of Bezier Curve
Problem: We would like to make an editable Bezier curve.
Task 1: Implement the de Castlejau algorithm for evaluating the entire 2D Bezier curve of degree n. This
program should be named as bezier1.xxx (your choice of extension) [2]
Task 2: Make your curve editable in the following sense: [2+2+2]
Addition of control Point: Every time we click on the canvas, a new point will be created and a
new Bezier curve of appropriate degree (based on the number of points) will be redrawn.
Deletion of control point: We can delete an already existing control point and redraw the new
Bezier curve of appropriate degree.
Control Point Movement: An user can drag any control point of the curve and correspondingly
the curve should get update automatically

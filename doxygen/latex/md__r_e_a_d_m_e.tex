Open\+GL implementation of Bezier Curve Problem\+: We would like to make an editable Bezier curve.~\newline
~\newline
 \subsection*{Task 1\+: Implement the de Castlejau algorithm for evaluating the entire 2D Bezier curve of degree n. \mbox{[}2\mbox{]}~\newline
~\newline
}

\subsection*{Task 2\+: Make your curve editable in the following sense\+: \mbox{[}2+2+2\mbox{]}~\newline
~\newline
}

\subsubsection*{Addition of control Point\+: Every time we click on the canvas, a new point will be created and a new Bezier curve of appropriate degree (based on the number of points) will be redrawn.}

\subsubsection*{Deletion of control point\+: We can delete an already existing control point and redraw the new Bezier curve of appropriate degree.}

\subsubsection*{Control Point Movement\+: An user can drag any control point of the curve and correspondingly the curve should get update automatically}

\section*{Free\+Glut Implementation.}

\subsubsection*{The \char`\"{}\+Bieser Curve.\+rar\char`\"{} file has the Visual Studio 2019 Solution File with all the Libraries Linked.}

The Project has the Following Functionality. Press Left Mouse Button to add point Press Middle(\+Scroll) Mouse Button to drag the nearest point to a new location Press Right Mouse Button to Remove the nearest point.

\subsubsection*{Our curve}



\subsubsection*{Add point by clicking the left mouse button}



\subsubsection*{Remove the point nearest to cursor by clicking the right mouse button}



\subsubsection*{Move the point nearest to cursor by clicking the scroll button}

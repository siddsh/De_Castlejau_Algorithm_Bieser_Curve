mouse The G\+L\+UT mouse function When left button of our mouse is pressed , we want to add a new point and change our bezier curve accordingly

Getting the x-\/y position of the cursor when the left button is clicked

We print out the co-\/ordinates to see that the axes and glut\+Ortho function is working correctly

Adding this to our original array of all the points as any point where the left click is pressed should be drawn and the bezier curve should be changed accordingly

When our right button of the mouse is pressed , we want to delete that point from our set of points to draw the bezier curve and hence the curve should be changed accordingly

Getting the x-\/y position of the cursor when the right button is clicked

We find the nearest point which is used to draw our bezier curve and remove that point. This is done because we cant always have pin point precision in removing a point.

Removing the point from our original vertex containing the points used to draw the bezier curve. After removing , we must update our bezier curve

Now we want to drag a point from the point where we click our middle button of our mouse and then draw it at the point where we release the middle button of our mouse

Getting the x-\/y position of the cursor when the middle button is clicked

We find the nearest point which is used to draw our bezier curve and select that point. This is done because we cant always have pin point precision in selecting a point.

Getting the x-\/y position of the cursor when the middle button is released

Now we change the point where our middle button was released in the original vertex vector and update the bezier curve accordingly

Save the mouse position
